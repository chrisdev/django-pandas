  efficient iteration in ``read_frame`` (by @wkschwartz)
- Add ``compress`` argument to ``read_frame`` to infer NumPy data types for the
  returned data frame's columns from the Django field types (by @wkschwartz)

0.5.0 (2018-01-20)
------------------

0.4.3 (2017-06-02)
--------------------
- Fix doc typos and formatting 
- Prevent column duplication in read_frame (Thanks Kevin Abbott) 

0.4.2 (2017-05-22)
--------------------
- Compatibility with `pandas 0.20.1`
- Support for Python 2.7 and 3.5 with Django versions 1.8+
- Suport for Python 3.6 and Django 1.11
- We still support legacy versions (Python 2.7 and Django 1.4)

0.4.1 (2016-02-05)
-------------------
- Address the incompatibility with Django 1.9 due to the removal of 
  specialized query sets like the 
  `ValuesQuerySet <https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/24211>`_
- Address the removal of the ``PassThrougManager`` from  ``django-model-utils``
  version ``2.4``.  We've removed the dependency on django-model-utils and 
  included the PassThroughManger (which was always a standalone tool 
  distributed a part of django-model-utils) for compatibility with 
  earlier versions of Django (<= 1.8). For more recent versions of 
  Django we're using Django's built in ``QuerySet.as_manager()``. 
- Now supports Pandas 0.14.1 and above
- The fall in Coverage in this release largely reflects the integration of
  the PassThroughManager into the code base. We'll add the required test 
  coverage for the PassThroughManager in subsequent releases.

0.3.1 (2015-10-25)
-------------------
- Extends the ability to span a ForeignKey relationship with double underscores
  to OneToOneField too thanks to Safe Hammad
- Provide better support for  ManyToMany and OneToMany relations thanks to 
  Jeff Sternberg and @MiddleFork

0.3.0 (2015-06-16)
---------------------
- This version supports Django 1.8
- Support for Pandas 0.16

0.2.2 (2015-03-02)
---------------------
- Added Support for Django 1.7

0.2.1 (2015-01-28)
---------------------
- Added Support for Values QuerySets 
- Support for Python 2.6
- Note we still have limited support for Django 1.7 but this will be coming in
  the next release

0.2.0 (2014-06-15)
--------------------

- Added the ``io`` module so that DataFrames can be created from any 
  queryset so you don't need to to add a ``DataFrame manager`` to your
  models. This is good for working with legacy projects.
- added a Boolean ``verbose`` argument to all methods (which defaults to ``True``)
  This populate the DataFrame columns with the human readable versions of 
  foreign key or choice fields.
- Improved the performance DataFrame creation by removing dependency on 
  ``np.core.records.fromrecords``
- Loads of bug fixes, more tests and improved coverage and better
  documentation`
